This is a test repository to see what GitHub is capable of.

The goal of this project is to become a game in the next 5 years. The main requirement for the game is to have a long, deep and compelling story, may be even a story that will develop in time. I am not sure what kind of game this will be, in what language or for which platform. This is to be decided and this README file will be changed accordingly.

REQUIREMENTS:
  open-source
  easy to port to different platforms
  long compelling story
